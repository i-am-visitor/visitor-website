## The Five Principles

<!-- <span class="image left"><img src="{{ "/images/pic04.jpg" | absolute_url }}" alt="" /></span> -->

The five principles for living are interconnected.  They are simple, but not easy.  The principles are introduced here as brief descriptions and are not meant to be a cure-all, rather they are meant to 'open a thought process or channel', and make you think.  Each description will be followed by a few related quotes and then links to blog posts with further reading on the topic.

<!-- ### Live to the Fullest -->

  <h3>Live to the Fullest</h3>
  Life on earth is fragile, so live it to the fullest.  Wake up each day with a purpose and let it drive you!  Rid yourself of ritual and the going-through-the-motions attitude.  It is essential that you make the time to do what you love, and do it now.  Be yourself and celebrate it, you are unique and there will never be another you.

  The purpose of life is to live it, to taste experience to the utmost, to reach out eagerly and without fear for newer and richer experience. -Eleanor Roosevelt

<!-- ### Love and Friendship -->

  <p>
  <h3>Love and Friendship</h3>
  Material things weave in and out of fashion, but love and friendship lasts for eternity.  Love and Friendships enrich our lives, alter our perceptions, hold us accountable, and give meaning to life on earth.  The more love you give, the more love you'll gain.  Life ends, love doesn't.  Hold material things loosely, but hold and love and friendships tight.

  Friendship doubles our joy and divides our grief. -Swedish Proverb

<!-- ### Do Good -->
<div class="box">
  <p>
  <h3>Do Good</h3> 
  Doing good warms the soul.  Small acts of kindness are compounded, each one building on the last, eventually affecting all those around you -haphazardly- making the world a kinder place.  Join the revolution: make someone smile, lend a helping hand, or simply commit an act of random kindness.  As you will find, giving is much more rewarding than receiving.  Do good often, it's contagious!

  We are here on earth to do good for others. What the others are here for, I don't know. -W.H. Auden
  </p>

<!-- ### Tread Lightly -->
<div class="box">
  <p>
  <h3>Tread Lightly</h3> 
  Tread lightly, our lifestyles affect more than we think.  We earthling often need to be reminded that we completely dependent on the environment.  Itâ€™s keeping us alive: supplying our air, water, heating, and food.  Without these elements, life as we know it would cease to exist.  Treat the environment with respect.  Before you consume, ask yourself, do I really need this item or is it making a brief layover at my house, and then off to landfill?  Utilize your power to purchase; vote with your dollar.

  When one tugs at a single thing in nature, he finds it attached to the rest of the world. -John Muir

<!-- ### Stay Focused -->
<div class="box">
  <p>
  <h3>Stay Focused</h3> 
  Today, more than ever, there are countless distractions.  We could easily fill our entire life consuming and digesting useless information and being over-stimulated, rendering us confused and unsatisfied.  To live a fulfilling life, we must stay focused on the things that matter the most.  In order to stay focused, we must filter what goes in, because, ultimately it affects what comes out.  In other words, if you focus on your dreams, you will eventually reach them.
  <br>

  One reason so few of us achieve what we truly want is that we never direct our focus; we never concentrate our power. Most people dabble their way through life, never deciding to master anything in particular. -Tony Robbins

On social media, we may share our own thoughts and advance our image notwithstanding spreading musings for different associations and affiliations. With such a critical number of associations with people and relationship on social media, our experience can be over-burden with a considerable measure of information.
